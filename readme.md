# CLI Weather App

Welcome to my CLI weather app! This is a simple command-line tool that provides weather information using the WeatherAPI. It allows you to quickly check the current weather conditions for a specific location.

## API Key

This app uses the WeatherAPI to fetch weather data. You'll need to sign up on their website and obtain an API key. Once you have the API key, place your key inside the variable on line 43 in the main.go file.

## Contributions

I welcome contributions to improve this CLI weather app. If you have ideas for new features or find any bugs, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy weather checking! ‚òÄÔ∏èüåßÔ∏è
